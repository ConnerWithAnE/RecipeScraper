Bring to the boil and simmer for 1 min then stir in the orange segments. Serve with jasmine rice.|Stir-fried duck with orange uses the classic flavour combination of rich duck balanced with tangy orange pepped up Oriental-style with ginger and sweet chilli sauce. Because duck is quite fatty it stays deliciously moist when stir-fried. It’s not cheap but this is a good recipe for making it stretch just that little bit further. Lamb would be a good alternative in this recipe if you didn’t want to use duck. When you fry the duck breasts, drain the fat and save it for cooking roast potatoes – they’ll be delicious. You can keep the fat in the fridge for several weeks in a covered container.
